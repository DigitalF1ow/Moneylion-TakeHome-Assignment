Hello there. This is the repository for the take home assignment.

There are two questions that are in the assignment.
Question 1 which involves counting the number of names according to the color they have.
Question 2 is about the Fibonacci Sequence. 

Both of the Questions are in the countFunction.js and fibonacci.js respectively.
Used NodeJS to test the Javascript file.

Website compatibility is tested as well. Both worked well. The html files are in the Backup folder.

Time spent so far, 
24 hours.
